    appInstance = {
        CategoryName: [
            {
                name: AirCondition
                data: 'src' || object etc.
            }

        ]
    }

    /**

    function StartApp(appInst) {
        appInst.Tasks.forEach(task => {
            eval(task);
        });
        
    }
